					1: "Â¡Che, tranqui!" is a common phrase heard on the streets of
					Argentina on a daily basis. "Che" is a way to call out to another
					person in the same way as we use "Dude" or "Bro" here in the United
					States. "Tranqui" is a command, short for "tranquilo" meaning relax or
					chill. I've combined the two into an idiomatic expression to imply my
					goal to be a chill, relaxed guy.
